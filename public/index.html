    <p>I have many hobbies including playing guitar, sports and outdoor activities. However, there is a hobby that I am really
      interested in and cannot wait to try. That is kiteboarding!</p>

    <p>Kiteboarding involves strapping yourself to a giant kite, jumping in the ocean and riding a board. While kiteboarding,
      it is possible to get several feet in the air while riding waves. Fortunately, Saint Petersburg is a hub for kiteboarding;
      people travel from all over the world to kiteboard here in St Pete. During the winter months when windy days are plentiful,
      one can find several people by the Skyway Bridge practicing their kiteboarding skills. I intend to take lessons as
      soon as winter comes back around!</p>
