      <p>I have many hobbies including playing guitar, sports and
        outdoor activities. However, there is a hobby that I am really
        interested in and cannot wait to try. That is kiteboarding!</p>

      <p>Kiteboarding involves strapping yourself to a giant kite,
        jumping in the ocean and riding a board. While kiteboarding, it is
        possible to get several feet in the air while riding waves. Fortunately,
        Saint Petersburg is a hub for kiteboarding; people travel from all over
        the world to kiteboard here in St Pete. During the winter months
        when windy days are plentiful, one can find several people by the
        Skyway Bridge practicing their kiteboarding skills. I intend to take
        lessons as soon as winter comes back around!</p><br><br>
